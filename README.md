# Conclusion

Our team bit off a bit more than we could chew on this one, as we were all first-time hackers and had little to no experience with web applications. We did our best, and managed to get up a web application than can display five markers customly input by the user, on a google map.  The backend is fully implemented, and users are able to register, login, and create tasks.
